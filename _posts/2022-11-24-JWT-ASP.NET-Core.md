.Net’s System.IdentityModel namespace defines great classes for generating and validating JSON Web Tokens. JWT Authentication is a great way to secure the API when working with front-end services, and how your backend allows you to handle this task is very important.
The process of working with JWT’s is ASP.NET Core is very clean and intuitive. Your main challenge is to understand how JWT’s work, and after that the framework will provide you great ways to get to work. In this post I’ll try to summarize the process of working with JWT’s with ASP.NET Core. Basic understanding of JWT’s is required. 

## JwtSecurityToken Class
This is the main class that builds the tokens. It is very flexible and offers variety of constructors to generate JWT’s, and you can choose one according to your needs. However, when first generating the token, most likely when an users request login and provides the correct email/username and password (and the record exists in database), the last constructor is the best choice. Let’s take a closer look:

You can check it <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.identitymodel.tokens.jwt.jwtsecuritytoken.-ctor?view=azure-dotnet#system-identitymodel-tokens-jwt-jwtsecuritytoken-ctor(system-string-system-string-system-collections-generic-ienumerable((system-security-claims-claim))-system-nullable((system-datetime))-system-nullable((system-datetime))-microsoft-identitymodel-tokens-signingcredentials)"> here </a?

As you can see, this constructor has the most important methods for generating a JWT, and most likely it’s all we’ll ever need. 
Before taking a look at SigningCredentials and Claims classes, let’s say a few words about the actual process.

## Creating the service for handling JWT’s
Usually, the best way is to define a single dedicated service that will handle the tokens. While we can inject desired services, these two main services can be considered mandatory: Iconfiguration and UserManager. 

In order to ensure the validity and security of our tokens, we need to hide the values of claims and keys that we are using. Technically, public keys and issuer/audience claims can be exposed, as they can be decoded anyway (but it’s a good practice to hide them), however our private (“secret”) key should never be exposed and hard-coded in our code.

That’s where the IConfiguration comes in: rather than assigning values to the token parameters directly, we store them in appsettings.json file, and retrieve them using configuration.

The UserManager is necessary in order to issue claims according to our user’s credentials.

We create the token using the constructor mentioned above. Usually, notBefore parameter can be ommited. The “issuer”, “audience”, “expires” parameters are well-known classes (String and DateTime), so let’s take a closer look at Claims and SigningCredentials.

## Claim Class
The claims have their own concrete class, rather than being added one-by-one. However, the class doesn’t add much of a complexity, and only is a way to encapsulate the String values as Claim objects. Although this class also defines many constructors, the Claim(String, String) is all we’’ll need in most of the cases.

Here’s a quirk, though: rather than providing the name of the claim directly, we (need to) use the ClaimTypes class. For example, to create a claim to hold an user’s username/email and role, respectively, we write:
    new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, name)/new Claim(ClaimTypes.Email, email)
    new Claim(ClaimsTypes.Role, role)

Name and Role types are the most common (and important) ones, but ClaimTypes class also offers much more kind of types, like Surname, Gender, StreetAddress, even HomePhone and many more.

Since the JwtSecurityToken’s constructor requires a collection of claims, we can write dedicated method that will return the value of List<Claim> for example, and pass the returned list to the constructor.

## SigningCredentials Class

In order to sign our JWT, we need our private key, and the algorithm. The SigningCredentials’s constructor
    SigningCredentials(SecurityKey, String)
matches this case perfectly.

SecurityKey is the base class to create a security keys. Rather than creating a base class instance, we create an instance of SymmetricSecurityKey, which extends the SecurityKey.
In order to create the symmetric security key, we need to pass an array of bytes to it’s constructor. For that purpose, we use "Encoding.GetBytes" method (with our security key as a parameter), and pass the generated array to the constructor. 

As for the algorithm, .Net provides a class named SecurityAlgorithms, and we can choose our desired algorithm from it’s fields. When working with JWT’s the preferred algorithm is HMACSHA256.

Here’s an example of generating the SigningCredentials:

## Http Headers

  After creating the token and issuing it (if an user provides correct credentials), the API should be able to validate tokens to give access to it’s resources only to authenticated users. In order to do that, we need to add the following lines to our Program.cs file: 

As you can see, the JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme has the value of “Bearer”, which means that the client, for example, the front-end application, should issue a request with  “Authorization” header, with the value of “Beaerer “+ourToken. (This can easily be done in Angular with an interceptor) After that, we can add [Authorize] attribute to our controllers, and they will be able to determine whether user has the permission to view requested resources or not.
Notes:
  
1)	JwtBearerDefaults package needs to be explicitly downloaded from NuGet Package Manager

2)	Don’t forget to add app.UseAuthentication() at the end of Program.cs file

## Conclusion
In this post, I try to summarize the process of using JWT validation is ASP.NET Core application. As you can see, if you understand JWT’s, the application provides you with all the tools needed. Methods/processes described here define the general and “standard” way, and of course can be customized as desired.
